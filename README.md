## Forked Use Case 

The following repository has been modified from its original source material, which was applied as an use case for the published paper

```
V. Zamborlini, R. Hoekstra, M. Silveira, C. Pruski, A. Teije, Generalizing the Detection of Internal and External Interactions in Clinical Guidelines, in: Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Health Informatics (HEALTHINF2016), Rome, Italy.

## Schema Folder

This folder contains the extended TMR schema to define subguidelines, that is, sets of recommendations from the same CIG which must be suggested as a whole for a particular clinical case.

## Instance Folder

This folder contains the three machine-interpretable clinical guidelines excerpts from the original use case -diabetes (DB), hypertension (HT) and osteoarthritis (OA)-, along with the combination of the them three as generated by the CIG interaction service embedded with an extended version of TMR model and endpoints for dynamically merging (parts of) CIGs. Additionally, it also holds data sets for care actions, causation beliefs and transitions/situations/properties. All of them have been reintroduced using the CIG interaction service:

## cds_hooks folder
This folder contains a definition of the CDS hook that triggers the request to extract and manipulate data with respect to the 3 CIGs, DB, HT and OA. It also contains an example of CDS hook following the definition. The CDS card response by the clinical decision support system to the CDS hook example can be found in the file FHIR_response.json also in this folder.
